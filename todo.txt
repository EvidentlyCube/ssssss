From Surreal's stream:
- Also add tile position to Tile Description popup
- Go through all rooms and give them difficult level in some scale, and then when selecting the first room to play it should chose from among the easy ones.

Planned changes:
 - ALlow controls with numpad even with disabled numlock
 - Allow solo play
 - Allow room selection
